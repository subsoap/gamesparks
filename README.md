# GameSparks
This is the GameSparks SDK for the [Defold game engine](http://www.defold.com).

## Installation
You can use the SDK in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

```

## Usage
For the usage see the [GameSparks documentation](https://docs.gamesparks.com) please.

There are no documents specific for Defold currently, but most of the guides for Corona can be adapted for use with Defold. Look for the Lua versions too.
